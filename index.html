                <p class="text">
                    The Pulse Width Modulation Project is to design and build the Pulse Width Modulation
                    circuit to control the speed of a DC motor. The circuit design's main idea is to use as
                    less space and as few wires as possible, and the circuit is organized tidily. The wires
                    and devices are connected using soldering. I have also learned to safely use soldering
                    tools and make effective soldering connections.

                <p class="text">
                    The house wiring project is to understand how a residential wiring system works and to wire basic devices, 
                such as receptacles, GFCI receptables, three-way switch and light terminals. I have learned to understand the hot, neutral
                and ground wire connections. I have also learned about the phantom voltage across the three-way switches.

                <p class="text">
                    The Panel Wiring project is to wire the circuit in a panel according to a schematic diagram. 
                    The circuit is to control the a water pumping station. I have learned to understand to read a schematic
                    diagram and install and use devices such as a programmable relay, din rails, terminals, push buttons, two-way switch, 
                    pilot lights and power supply.
