                    The Pulse Width Modulation Project is to design and build the Pulse Width Modulation
                    circuit to control the speed of a DC motor. The circuit design's main idea is to use as
                    less space and as few wires as possible, and the circuit is organized tidily. The wires
                    and devices are connected using soldering. I have also learned to safely use soldering
                    tools and make effective soldering connections.
